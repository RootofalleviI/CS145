6. CS145 Final Review V1.1.pdf
   I thought I was gonna put everything into a huge file but then I realized it's a bad idea...
   But I'm too lazy to take care of this file...
   I think there are some random topics in it...
   
I'm pretty sure there are countless typos and minor mistakes (hopefully no significant ones, 
just stuff like missing brackets or writing function as "functino" or lambda as "lamdba", etc.)
so when you read them please question everything (yes you should question everything in your life
on a daily basis) and only believe what I write is correct after you do the proof by yourself.

OK good luck on the final exam.
And someone please teach me how to use github lul...

Best,
David
